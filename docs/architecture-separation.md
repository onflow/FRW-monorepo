# Flow Reference Wallet - Architecture Separation

## Folder Structure & Import Rules

This document outlines the architectural boundaries and import rules enforced by ESLint in the Flow Reference Wallet Chrome extension.

## Overview

The codebase is organized into distinct layers with strict import rules to maintain separation of concerns and prevent architectural violations. Each folder has specific responsibilities and controlled dependencies.

## Folder Structure

```

## Import Rules (Simplified)

### Key Principles

1. **Use aliases for cross-folder imports**: Always use `@/folder/*` syntax
2. **Shared package imports**: Use `@onflow/flow-wallet-shared/*`
3. **Layer boundaries are enforced**: UI ↔ Core/Background separation
4. **Relative imports allowed within folders**: Use `./` or `../` within the same folder

### Examples

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - importing from shared package
import { SomeType } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-shared/types/some-type';
import { formatAddress } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-shared/utils/address';

// ✅ Correct - cross-folder imports with aliases
import { walletService } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-core/service/wallet';
import { Button } from '@/ui/components/Button';
import { useWallet } from '@/ui/hooks/use-wallet';

// ✅ Correct - relative imports within same folder
import { helper } from './helper';
import { utils } from '../utils';
```

### Relative Imports (Only within same subfolder)

Use relative imports only within the same subfolder:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - within same subfolder
import { helper } from './helper';
import { Component } from '../SubFolder/Component';
import { utils } from '../../utils/index';
```

### UI Import Hierarchy

```typescript
// ✅ Views can import components
import { AccountCard } from '@/ui/components/account/account-card';

// ✅ Components can import hooks
import { useWallet } from '@/ui/hooks/use-wallet';

// ✅ Hooks can import reducers from package
import { accountReducer } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-reducers/account-reducer';

// ✅ Anyone can import from shared
import { formatAddress } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-shared/utils/address';
```

### Forbidden Patterns

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - UI importing from core
import { keyringService } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-core/service/keyring';

// ❌ Wrong - Core importing from UI
import { Button } from '@/ui/components/Button';

// ❌ Wrong - Background importing from UI
import { useWallet } from '@/ui/hooks/use-wallet';

// ❌ Wrong - Components importing reducers from old location
import { accountReducer } from '@/ui/reducers/account-reducer';
// ✅ Correct - Import from the package
import { accountReducer } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-reducers/account-reducer';

// ❌ Wrong - Using old shared path
import { formatAddress } from '@/shared/utils/address';
// ✅ Correct - Use the package name
import { formatAddress } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-shared/utils/address';
```

## Communication Patterns

### UI ↔ Background Communication

UI communicates with background through Chrome extension messaging:

```typescript
// UI hooks
export const useWallet = () => {
  const walletController = new WalletController();

  const getAccounts = async () => {
    return await walletController.getAccounts();
  };

  return { getAccounts };
};

// Background side
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  // Handle messages from UI
});
```

### UI Internal Communication

```typescript
// Views use components and hooks
const Dashboard = () => {
  const { accounts } = useWallet(); // Hook for data

  return (
    <div>
      <AccountCard account={accounts[0]} /> {/* Component for UI */}
    </div>
  );
};

// Hooks use reducers from the package for state management
import { walletReducer } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-reducers/wallet-reducer';

const useWallet = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(walletReducer, initialState);
  // ...
};
```

### Background ↔ Core Communication

Background directly imports and uses core services:

```typescript
// Background
import { keyringService } from '@onflow/flow-wallet-core/service/keyring';
const accounts = await keyringService.getAccounts();
```

## ESLint Enforcement (Simplified)

The ESLint rules have been simplified to focus on the essential architectural boundaries:

1. **Background folder**:
   - Cannot import from `@/ui/*`
   - All other imports allowed

2. **Core folder**:
   - Cannot import from `@/ui/*`
   - Can only import `@/background/webapi/*` from background
   - All other imports allowed

3. **Core services**:
   - Same as core, plus:
   - Can only import from `@onflow/flow-wallet-core/service/*` or `@onflow/flow-wallet-core/utils/*` within core

4. **UI folder**:
   - Cannot import from `@onflow/flow-wallet-core/*` or `@/background/*`
   - All other imports allowed

5. **Reducers package** (`@onflow/flow-wallet-reducers`):
   - Can only import from `@onflow/flow-wallet-shared/*`
   - Must remain pure (no imports from other layers or packages)

6. **Content script**:
   - Cannot import from `@/ui/*` or `@onflow/flow-wallet-core/*`
   - Can import from `@/background/*` and shared

## Benefits

This architecture provides:

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Maintainable codebase**: Easier to understand and modify
- **Testable code**: Isolated layers can be tested independently
- **Chrome extension compliance**: Proper separation between contexts
- **Security**: Background service worker isolation
- **Scalability**: Clear boundaries for future development
- **Predictable state management**: Isolated reducers ensure predictable state changes
- **Reusable components**: Components can be used across different views
- **Organized UI structure**: Clear hierarchy from views → components → hooks → reducers

## Development Guidelines

1. **Before adding imports**: Check if the import follows the architectural rules
2. **Use aliases**: Always use `@/folder/*` aliases for cross-folder imports
3. **Use package imports**: Import from `@onflow/flow-wallet-shared/*` and `@onflow/flow-wallet-reducers/*`
4. **Keep layers isolated**: Don't create direct dependencies between UI and core
5. **Use messaging**: UI should communicate with core through background messaging
6. **Shared utilities**: Put common code in shared package, not in specific layers
7. **UI hierarchy**: Follow views → components → hooks pattern (reducers are now separate)
8. **Pure reducers**: Reducers must remain in the separate package and stay pure
9. **Reusable components**: Design components to be reusable across different views

## Violations and Fixes

If you encounter ESLint violations:

1. **"UI cannot import from Core layer"**: Use the wallet controller messaging instead
2. **"Core cannot import from UI layer"**: Core should not depend on UI components
3. **"Background cannot import from UI layer"**: Background is a service worker without DOM access
4. **"Reducers must be pure"**: Reducers are now in a separate package and can only import from shared
5. **"Core services can only import webapi from background"**: Use the webapi module for browser APIs
6. **"Cannot import reducers from old location"**: Import from `@onflow/flow-wallet-reducers/*` instead

This architecture ensures a maintainable, secure, and scalable Chrome extension codebase with clear separation of concerns at both the application and UI levels.
