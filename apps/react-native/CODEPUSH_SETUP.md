# CodePush Setup Status

## Current Status: ✅ ENABLED AND WORKING

CodePush successfully enabled using `@bravemobile/react-native-code-push` v11.0.0 - a community fork with React Native 0.70+ compatibility!

## Issue Resolution

**Problem:**

```
A problem occurred evaluating project ':react-native-code-push'.
> Could not find method android() for arguments [...] on project ':react-native-code-push'
```

**Problem:** Official Microsoft CodePush packages incompatible with React Native 0.80:

1. **react-native-code-push v9.0.1**: `ChoreographerCompat` class removed in RN 0.80
2. **react-native-code-push v8.3.1**: Gradle variant matching issues with autolinking

**Solution Found:**
✅ **@bravemobile/react-native-code-push v11.0.0** - Community fork specifically maintained for React Native 0.70+ compatibility

- Fixes ChoreographerCompat issues
- Proper autolinking support
- Maintained specifically for newer React Native versions
